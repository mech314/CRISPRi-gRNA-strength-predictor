# CRISPRi-gRNA-strength-predictor

This repository focuses on predicting the strength of CRISPRi-mediated gene repression using machine learning. By leveraging reported features from modern literature, including gRNA sequences and their distance from the PAM site, we aim to train a classification model that identifies key factors influencing repression strength. Additionally, this project explores inconsistencies in the reported data to provide insights into contradictory findings and improve our understanding of the factors driving CRISPRi effectiveness.
